:ref:`--import-mode=importlib <import-mode-importlib>` now tries to import modules using the standard import mechanism (but still without changing :py:data:`sys.path`), falling back to importing modules directly only if that fails.

This means that installed packages will be imported under their canonical name if possible first, for example ``app.core.models``, instead of having the module name always be derived from their path (for example ``.env310.lib.site_packages.app.core.models``).
